# Logo Design Prompt Algorithm

## Summary
This document captures the iterative prompting algorithm used to create the Electric Sheep logo, extracted from Cursor conversation history.

## The Algorithm Pattern

Based on the conversation history found in Cursor's composer data, here's the iterative prompting pattern that led to the final logo:

### Initial Request
**Prompt 1:** "I don't like the logo, and I'm not sure the colour scheme has worked. Come up with a new logo that's simpler and less image-based, and check that the colour scheme has been applied across the whole app"

### Iteration 1: Focus on Simplicity
**Prompt 2:** "I still really don't like the icon - let's start again with it. Simple, monogram, elegant, suitable for colour-blindness. Particularly focus on simplicity and low cognitive effort"

### Iteration 2: Design Language Consistency
**Prompt 3:** "Ok new plan - we need design language for both. If using ES for one causes a problem, can we change the icon to something better suited for vector paths, that has a link to the concept, but is intentially designed to suit the technology well? I'd like the colours to be more similar if possible"

### Iteration 3: Conceptual Shift
**Prompt 4:** "Less of the electric focus - it's a reference to philip k dick's novel. See if there are any themes in there that also strongly implement a feeling of calm we can use. It doesn't necessarily need to be an image of a concrete entity, it can be quite abstract"

### Iteration 4: Refinement
**Prompt 5:** "I like the idea, unfortunately it looks quite a bit like a pair of pants. Use the same themes but try a different version. Meanwhile, review the spacing on the landing page, I feel like the feature flag icon and staging icon don't gel well. Try to make the layout emphasize the important aspects and add some semantic value to someone looking at it"

### Final Result
The final logo became:
- **Sheep body**: Cloud-like shape in teal-blue (#4A7C7E)
- **Sheep head**: Rounded, calm appearance
- **Lightning bolt**: Warm amber (#D4885A) - color-blind friendly
- **Electric sparks**: Small amber dots around the sheep
- **Eyes**: White circles for detail
- **Overall**: Simple, geometric, calming, accessible

## Key Algorithm Principles

1. **Start with dissatisfaction** - "I don't like X"
2. **Specify constraints** - "simple, monogram, elegant, color-blind friendly"
3. **Iterate on concept** - Shift from literal to abstract
4. **Refine based on feedback** - "looks like pants, try different version"
5. **Consider context** - "review spacing, emphasize important aspects"
6. **Maintain consistency** - "design language for both" (icon and logo)

## Design Constraints Applied

- **Simplicity**: Low cognitive effort
- **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly
- **Technology fit**: Suited for vector paths
- **Conceptual**: Reference to Philip K. Dick's novel
- **Calm aesthetic**: Non-intrusive, peaceful
- **Consistency**: Unified design language

## Color Evolution

- **Initial**: Purple (#6200EE) with yellow/gold lightning
- **Final**: Teal-blue (#4A7C7E) with warm amber (#D4885A) lightning
- **Rationale**: Color-blind friendly, calming, accessible

## File History Evidence
