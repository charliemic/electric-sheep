# Agent Coordination Log

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-19  
**Purpose**: Track which agents are working on which files to prevent conflicts

**How to Use:**
1. Before starting work, check this document for conflicts
2. Add your work entry with branch name and files you'll modify
3. Update status as you progress (In Progress → Complete)
4. Remove entry after merge

**Quick Check:**
```bash
./scripts/check-agent-coordination.sh
```

## Current Work Status

**Note:** Agents are ephemeral - entries track tasks, not specific agents.

### Example Entry Format:
```
### Task: <task-name>
- **Branch**: `feature/<task-name>`
- **Worktree**: `../electric-sheep-<task-name>` (if using worktree)
- **Status**: In Progress / Complete
- **Files Modified**: List of files
- **Isolation Strategy**: worktree / clone / branch
- **Conflicts**: None / List conflicts
- **ETA**: Date or status
```

## Active Work

*No active work currently - add entries here as agents start tasks*

## Shared Files (Require Coordination)

These files are commonly modified and require coordination:

- ⚠️ `app/src/main/.../ui/screens/LandingScreen.kt`
- ⚠️ `app/src/main/.../ElectricSheepApplication.kt`
- ⚠️ `app/src/main/.../data/DataModule.kt`
- ⚠️ `app/build.gradle.kts`
- ⚠️ `build.gradle.kts`
- ⚠️ `gradle.properties`

**Recommendation:** Use git worktree when modifying shared files for complete file system isolation.

## Conflict Resolution

**When conflicts are detected:**

1. **Check this document** - See if another task is working on the same file
2. **Coordinate** - Document the overlap and decide on approach:
   - Sequential work (one task completes, then next)
   - Split work (different parts of file)
   - Use git worktree for complete isolation
3. **Update entry** - Document resolution in task entry

## Workflow Guidelines

### Before Starting Work
1. Check this document for file conflicts
2. Create feature branch: `feature/<task-name>`
3. **Consider git worktree** for file system isolation: `./scripts/create-worktree.sh <task-name>`
4. Pull latest `main`: `git pull origin main`
5. Add entry to this document with your task details
6. Document which files you'll modify

### During Work
1. Commit frequently (at least daily)
2. Push branch regularly (backup)
3. Update this document if scope changes
4. Test changes in isolation

### Before Merging
1. Rebase on latest `main`: `git rebase origin/main`
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Run tests
4. Update documentation
5. Create PR with clear description
6. Update this document to "Complete"

### After Merging
1. Remove worktree (if used): `git worktree remove ../electric-sheep-<task-name>`
2. Delete feature branch: `git branch -d feature/<task-name>`
3. Update this document
4. Pull latest `main` before next work

## Notes

### 2025-11-19: Multi-Agent Conflict Resolution
- Three agents worked simultaneously on overlapping features
- Environment switching merged successfully
- Design components and test helpers are local only
- Need to commit local improvements and verify no conflicts
- Implemented coordination workflow to prevent future conflicts

### Next Coordination Check
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Action**: Review all local untracked files and commit appropriate ones
- **Priority**: High - Get valuable work into version control
