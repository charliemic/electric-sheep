# Writing Style Guidelines for AI-Generated Content

Lessons learned from editing AI-generated content to match natural human writing.

## Key Differences: AI vs. Human Writing

### 1. Framing: Discovery vs. Structure

**AI tendency:** Formal, goal-oriented, prescriptive
- "I set out to answer four questions"
- "I decided to treat X as an experiment"
- Makes it sound like a planned, structured approach

**Human reality:** Exploratory, discovery-oriented, organic
- "I set out to learn about X so I can be more informed"
- "Through that process, I began to realise that..."
- Focuses on learning and discovery, not predetermined goals

**Guideline:** Frame as exploration and discovery, not formal experiments with predetermined questions.

### 2. Certainty vs. Uncertainty

**AI tendency:** Over-confident, definitive statements
- "I have answers to all four"
- "The solution is..."
- Makes everything sound certain and complete

**Human reality:** More tentative, acknowledges learning process
- "I found that..."
- "I began to realise..."
- "These turned out to be..."
- Acknowledges the process of discovery

**Guideline:** Use language that reflects the learning process, not final answers.

### 3. Structure: Over-Organised vs. Natural Flow

**AI tendency:** Heavy structure, clear sections, formal headings
- "The Experiment"
- "Key Principle:" callouts
- Over-categorised and formulaic

**Human reality:** More natural flow, less formal structure
- "What I Discovered"
- Insights emerge naturally, not as formal principles
- Less rigid categorisation

**Guideline:** Use natural headings and flow, avoid over-structuring.

### 4. Tone: Enthusiastic vs. Cynical/Practical

**AI tendency:** Overly enthusiastic, "discovery" language
- "What I discovered surprised me"
- "The most interesting discovery"
- "The AI part works fine!" (gushing)
- Over-emphasises the significance

**Human reality:** More cynical, practical, matter-of-fact
- States things directly without enthusiasm
- Skeptical starting point ("AI is good at X, but Y is uncertain")
- Less meta-commentary about the process
- Focuses on content, not the act of discovering
- Acknowledges limitations and uncertainties

**Guideline:** Be direct, cynical, and practical. Avoid gushing about AI. Start from a position of skepticism and practicality.

### 5. Formatting: Over-Formatted vs. Natural

**AI tendency:** Heavy use of bold, callouts, structured lists
- "**Key Principle:**" everywhere
- Over-use of bold for emphasis
- Too many structured lists

**Human reality:** Minimal formatting, natural emphasis
- Bold used sparingly
- Lists when helpful, not everywhere
- Natural flow of text

**Guideline:** Use formatting sparingly, let content speak for itself.

## Patterns to Avoid

1. ❌ "I set out to answer X questions" → ✅ "I set out to learn about X"
2. ❌ "I decided to treat X as an experiment" → ✅ "I explored X"
3. ❌ "I have answers to all four" → ✅ "I found that these areas matter"
4. ❌ "Key Principle:" callouts → ✅ Natural integration of insights
5. ❌ "What I discovered surprised me" → ✅ Direct statement of findings
6. ❌ Over-structured sections → ✅ Natural flow and organisation
7. ❌ Over-enthusiastic about AI ("The AI part works fine!") → ✅ Cynical, practical ("AI is good at X, but Y is the hard part")
8. ❌ Gushing language → ✅ Matter-of-fact, skeptical tone

## Patterns to Use

1. ✅ Frame as learning and exploration
2. ✅ Use tentative language ("I began to realise", "I found that")
3. ✅ Natural headings that reflect content, not structure
4. ✅ Matter-of-fact tone
5. ✅ Minimal formatting
6. ✅ Focus on what was learned, not the process of learning

## Example Transformation

**Before (AI-style):**
> I set out to answer four questions. A week later, I have answers to all four, and they're more interconnected than I expected.

**After (Human-style):**
> I set out to learn about AI tooling so I can be more informed and helpful as we adopt it. Through that process, I began to realise that certain factors were important. These turned out to be more interconnected than I expected.

## Application

When generating content:
- Start with learning/exploration goals, not formal questions
- Use discovery language, not certainty language
- Let insights emerge naturally
- Be matter-of-fact, not enthusiastic
- Use minimal formatting
- Focus on what was learned, not the meta-process
