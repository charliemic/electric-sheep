# Branch Isolation and Multi-Agent Workflow Rules

## CRITICAL: Never Work on Main Branch

**Before making ANY changes, you MUST:**

1. **Check current branch:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # or
   git branch
   ```

2. **If on `main` branch, IMMEDIATELY create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<task-description>
   # Or use git worktree for file system isolation:
   # git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
   ```

3. **Never commit directly to `main`** - All changes must go through feature branches.

## Branch Naming Convention

**Required format:** `<type>/<task-description>`

**Types:**
- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `test/` - Test improvements

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feature/test-helpers`
- ✅ `feature/env-switch`
- ✅ `fix/login-bug`
- ✅ `refactor/component-cleanup`
- ❌ `feature/my-feature` (too vague - be descriptive)
- ❌ `test-helpers` (missing type prefix)

**Note:** Agents are ephemeral - branch names should describe the task, not identify the agent.

## File System Isolation (RECOMMENDED)

**For complete file system isolation, use git worktrees:**

```bash
# Create isolated worktree
git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
# Work in complete isolation
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete file system isolation
- No conflicts with other agents
- Easy cleanup after merge

## Pre-Work Checklist (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Run automated pre-work check before starting ANY work:**

```bash
./scripts/pre-work-check.sh
```

This script automatically verifies:
1. ✅ **Not on main branch** - Prevents working on main
2. ✅ **Latest main pulled** - Checks for remote updates
3. ✅ **Coordination checked** - Runs `check-agent-coordination.sh`
4. ✅ **Handover queue checked** - Reviews pending handovers (pick up if available)
5. ✅ **Relevant rules discovered** - Suggests applicable cursor rules
6. ✅ **Available tools identified** - Lists automation scripts
7. ✅ **Working directory clean** - Checks for uncommitted changes
8. ✅ **Handover detection** - Checks if handover needed for current work

**If the script reports errors, fix them before proceeding.**

**Manual steps (if needed):**
1. ✅ **Create feature branch** - Use proper naming convention
2. ✅ **Use worktree if needed** - `./scripts/create-worktree.sh <task-name>`
3. ✅ **Update coordination doc** - `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`

## File Coordination

**Before modifying files, check coordination:**

**Shared files (require coordination):**
- `app/.../ui/screens/LandingScreen.kt`
- `app/.../ElectricSheepApplication.kt`
- `app/.../data/DataModule.kt`
- `app/build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`

**If modifying shared files:**
1. Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` for conflicts
2. Document your changes in coordination doc
3. Consider using git worktree for isolation
4. Coordinate with other agents if needed

## Workflow Enforcement

**When user asks you to make changes:**

1. **MANDATORY: Run pre-work check first:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-work-check.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify you're not on main
   - Check for remote updates
   - Run coordination checks
   - Discover relevant rules
   - Identify available tools

2. **If on main, STOP and create branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<task-description>
   # Or for file system isolation:
   ./scripts/create-worktree.sh <task-name>
   ```

3. **Discover relevant rules:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/discover-rules.sh <task-keyword>
   ```
   Read the suggested rules and reference them explicitly in your implementation.

4. **Before modifying files, check coordination:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-agent-coordination.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Check for shared file conflicts
   - Warn about high-risk files
   - Suggest worktree usage if needed

5. **After work, update coordination doc:**
   - Mark work as "In Progress" or "Complete"
   - List files you modified

## Commit Rules

**Before committing:**

1. ✅ **Pre-commit hook runs automatically** - Prevents commits to main
2. ✅ Verify you're on a feature branch (not `main`)
3. ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
4. ✅ Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
5. ✅ Run tests: `./gradlew test` (all tests must pass)

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
[optional: AI-generated code indicator]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**AI Code Provenance (Optional but Recommended):**
- If code was AI-generated: Add `[AI]` prefix or note in body
- If code was AI-generated with human edits: Note significant edits
- Example: `feat: [AI] Add user authentication flow` or `feat: Add feature (AI-generated, human-reviewed)`

**Research shows**: Tracking AI code provenance improves learning and prompt effectiveness

**CRITICAL: Commit Frequently (Safety Net)**
- ✅ **Commit frequently** - Every 15-30 minutes, even if work is incomplete
- ✅ **Use WIP commits** - `git commit -m "WIP: <description>"` for incomplete work
- ✅ **Commit after each logical step** - Don't wait for feature completion
- ✅ **Commit before risky operations** - Before refactoring, large changes, experiments
- ✅ **Local commits only** - No need to push every commit (push when ready for review)

**See:** `.cursor/rules/frequent-commits.mdc` for complete frequent commit guidelines

## Error Prevention

**If you detect these conditions, STOP and fix:**

- ❌ User is on `main` branch → Create feature branch immediately
- ❌ Branch name doesn't follow convention → Rename branch
- ❌ Modifying shared file without coordination → Check coordination doc first
- ❌ Tests failing → Fix tests before proceeding
- ❌ Uncommitted work on `main` → Move to feature branch
- ❌ File system conflicts → Use git worktree for isolation

## Post-Merge Cleanup (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Run automated cleanup after PR merge:**

```bash
./scripts/post-merge-cleanup.sh <pr-number>
```

This script automatically:
- Checks other active work (worktrees and branches)
- Verifies PR merge status
- Switches to main and pulls latest
- Deletes merged branches
- Removes associated worktrees
- Cleans up temp branches
- Prunes stale worktree references

**Manual cleanup (if automation unavailable):**

### Step 0: Check Other Agents and Worktrees (REQUIRED)

**Before cleaning up, ALWAYS check and report on other active work:**

1. **List all worktrees:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

2. **List all branches (local and remote):**
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

3. **Check for other active work:**
   ```bash
   # List all worktrees with their branches
   git worktree list --porcelain | grep -E "^(worktree|HEAD|branch)" | paste - - -
   
   # List all feature branches
   git branch | grep -E "^  (feature|fix|refactor|docs|test)/"
   
   # List remote branches
   git branch -r | grep -E "(feature|fix|refactor|docs|test)/"
   ```

4. **Report status to user:**
   - List all worktrees and their associated branches
   - List all feature branches (local and remote)
   - Describe the status of each (active, merged, stale)
   - Ask user to verify before deleting anything

**Example output format:**
```
Active Worktrees:
  /path/to/electric-sheep-runtime-visual-evaluation [feature/runtime-visual-evaluation-architecture] - Active work
  /path/to/electric-sheep-other-work [feature/other-task] - Active work

Active Branches:
  feature/runtime-visual-evaluation-architecture - Has unmerged commits
  feature/other-task - Has unmerged commits
  feature/aws-bedrock-security-goals - MERGED (ready to delete)

Please verify these are correct before cleanup proceeds.
```

### Step 1: Switch to Main Branch
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Delete Merged Feature Branch
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/<branch-name>
   # Use -D if branch has unmerged commits (shouldn't happen if PR merged)
   ```

### Step 3: Remove Worktree (if used)
   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
   # Or if worktree directory was deleted manually:
   git worktree prune
   ```

### Step 4: Delete Duplicate/Old Branches
   ```bash
   # Check for duplicate branches (e.g., -rebased, -old, -backup)
   git branch | grep <branch-name>
   # Delete if duplicate: git branch -D <duplicate-branch>
   ```

### Step 5: Delete Temp/Test Branches
   ```bash
   # Delete branches starting with temp/, tmp/, test-merge, etc.
   git branch | grep -E "^(temp|tmp|test-)" | xargs git branch -D
   ```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents branch clutter
- Avoids confusion about which branch to use
- Keeps repository state clean
- Makes it easier to identify active work

**Best Practice:**
- Always start new work from a fresh `main` branch
- Never continue work on a merged branch
- Create a new feature branch for follow-up work

## Multi-Agent Coordination

**Always:**
- Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` before starting
- Document your work in coordination doc
- Update coordination doc when work status changes
- Coordinate if files overlap with other agents
- Use git worktree for file system isolation when needed

**See:** `docs/development/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for complete guidelines

## Agent Handover Patterns

**When to create a handover document:**

1. **Major milestone completed** - Feature deployed, refactoring done, infrastructure change complete
2. **Task completion** - All planned work done, ready for next phase
3. **Natural breakpoint** - Logical stopping point, context switch needed
4. **Deployment complete** - Changes deployed and validated
5. **Complex work completed** - Multi-step task finished, integration done
6. **Effectiveness threshold exceeded** - Agent effectiveness degrading (see detection)

**Handover document should include:**
- Context of work done
- Current state (completed, in progress)
- Next steps clearly defined
- Key documents/files to review
- Deployment status
- Open questions/decisions

**See:** `docs/development/workflow/AGENT_HANDOVER_PATTERNS.md` for complete guidelines

## Agent Effectiveness Monitoring

**Research shows**: Agents can become less effective over time due to:
- Context growth (conversation length, accumulated decisions)
- Cognitive load accumulation
- Information overload
- Conflicting context

**Detection thresholds** (handover recommended when exceeded):
- Conversation turns > 100
- Time elapsed > 4 hours
- Context tokens > 100,000
- Error rate > 3 failures
- Repetition count > 3

**Check if handover needed:**
```bash
./scripts/detect-handover-needed.sh
```

**Create handover:**
```bash
./scripts/create-handover.sh [task-name]
```

**Check handover queue:**
- Review `docs/development/workflow/HANDOVER_QUEUE.md` before starting work
- Pick highest priority handover if available
- Update status when working on handover

**See:** 
- `.cursor/rules/agent-effectiveness.mdc` - Complete effectiveness monitoring rule
- `docs/development/workflow/AGENT_EFFECTIVENESS_DEGRADATION.md` - Degradation analysis
- `docs/development/workflow/HANDOVER_QUEUE_SYSTEM.md` - Queue system design
