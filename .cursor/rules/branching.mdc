# Branch Isolation and Multi-Agent Workflow Rules

## CRITICAL: Never Work on Main Branch

**Before making ANY changes, you MUST:**

1. **Check current branch:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # or
   git branch
   ```

2. **If on `main` branch, IMMEDIATELY create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<task-description>
   # Or use git worktree for file system isolation:
   # git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
   ```

3. **Never commit directly to `main`** - All changes must go through feature branches.

## Branch Naming Convention

**Required format:** `<type>/<task-description>`

**Types:**
- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `test/` - Test improvements

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feature/test-helpers`
- ✅ `feature/env-switch`
- ✅ `fix/login-bug`
- ✅ `refactor/component-cleanup`
- ❌ `feature/my-feature` (too vague - be descriptive)
- ❌ `test-helpers` (missing type prefix)

**Note:** Agents are ephemeral - branch names should describe the task, not identify the agent.

## File System Isolation (RECOMMENDED)

**For complete file system isolation, use git worktrees:**

```bash
# Create isolated worktree
git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
# Work in complete isolation
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete file system isolation
- No conflicts with other agents
- Easy cleanup after merge

## Pre-Work Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before starting any work, you MUST:

1. ✅ **Verify NOT on main branch** - Check `git status`
2. ✅ **Create feature branch** - Use proper naming convention
3. ✅ **Consider file system isolation** - Use git worktree if working on shared files
4. ✅ **Pull latest main** - `git pull origin main`
5. ✅ **Check coordination doc** - Read `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`
6. ✅ **Document your work** - Update coordination doc with your planned changes

## File Coordination

**Before modifying files, check coordination:**

**Shared files (require coordination):**
- `app/.../ui/screens/LandingScreen.kt`
- `app/.../ElectricSheepApplication.kt`
- `app/.../data/DataModule.kt`
- `app/build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`

**If modifying shared files:**
1. Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` for conflicts
2. Document your changes in coordination doc
3. Consider using git worktree for isolation
4. Coordinate with other agents if needed

## Workflow Enforcement

**When user asks you to make changes:**

1. **First, check branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **If on main, STOP and create branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<task-description>
   # Or for file system isolation:
   # git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
   ```

3. **Before modifying files, check coordination:**
   - Read `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`
   - Verify no conflicts with other agents
   - Document your planned changes
   - Consider git worktree if modifying shared files

4. **After work, update coordination doc:**
   - Mark work as "In Progress" or "Complete"
   - List files you modified

## Commit Rules

**Before committing:**

1. ✅ Verify you're on a feature branch (not `main`)
2. ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
3. ✅ Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
4. ✅ Run tests if applicable

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

## Error Prevention

**If you detect these conditions, STOP and fix:**

- ❌ User is on `main` branch → Create feature branch immediately
- ❌ Branch name doesn't follow convention → Rename branch
- ❌ Modifying shared file without coordination → Check coordination doc first
- ❌ Tests failing → Fix tests before proceeding
- ❌ Uncommitted work on `main` → Move to feature branch
- ❌ File system conflicts → Use git worktree for isolation

## Multi-Agent Coordination

**Always:**
- Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` before starting
- Document your work in coordination doc
- Update coordination doc when work status changes
- Coordinate if files overlap with other agents
- Use git worktree for file system isolation when needed

**See:** `docs/development/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for complete guidelines
