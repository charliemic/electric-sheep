# Branch Isolation and Multi-Agent Workflow Rules

## CRITICAL: Never Work on Main Branch

**Before making ANY changes, you MUST:**

1. **Check current branch:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # or
   git branch
   ```

2. **If on `main` branch, IMMEDIATELY create isolated worktree:**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Use git worktree for isolation
   git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
   cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
   # Now working in isolated directory
   ```
   
   **Note:** This is a **rule-required action** (marked "IMMEDIATELY") - always PROCEED automatically without prompting. See `.cursor/rules/smart-prompts.mdc` for evaluation logic.

3. **Never commit directly to `main`** - All changes must go through feature branches.

## Branch Naming Convention

**Required format:** `<type>/<task-description>`

**Recommended format (for auto-label updates):** `<type>/<issue-number>-<task-description>`

**Types:**
- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `test/` - Test improvements

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feature/test-helpers` (standard format)
- ✅ `feature/52-configure-release-signing` (with issue number - enables auto-label updates)
- ✅ `fix/55-crash-reporting-integration` (with issue number)
- ✅ `refactor/component-cleanup` (standard format)
- ❌ `feature/my-feature` (too vague - be descriptive)
- ❌ `test-helpers` (missing type prefix)

**Note:** Agents are ephemeral - branch names should describe the task, not identify the agent.

**Auto-Label Updates:**
- If branch name includes issue number (e.g., `feature/52-<description>`), pre-work check will automatically update issue status to `in-progress`
- Format: `<type>/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Example: `feature/52-configure-release-signing` → Auto-updates issue #52 to `status:in-progress`

## File System Isolation (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Every agent MUST use git worktree for complete file system isolation.**

**MANDATORY: Create isolated worktree before ANY work:**

```bash
# Create isolated worktree (MANDATORY for all agents)
git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
# Work in complete isolation
```

**Why Mandatory:**
- ✅ Complete file system isolation - prevents untracked file conflicts
- ✅ No conflicts with other agents - each agent has own directory
- ✅ Easy cleanup after merge - just remove worktree
- ✅ Prevents workspace pollution - untracked files don't interfere
- ✅ Eliminates branch switching errors - each worktree is on its own branch

**Exception: Shared Files Requiring Coordination**
- ⚠️ **ONLY exception**: When agent coordination explicitly requires working on shared files
- ⚠️ **Must be documented**: Exception must be documented in `AGENT_COORDINATION.md`
- ⚠️ **Coordination required**: Must coordinate with other agents before proceeding
- ⚠️ **Still use worktree**: Even for shared files, use worktree unless coordination explicitly requires shared workspace

**Default Rule: ALWAYS use worktree. Exception only when coordination requires shared files.**

## Pre-Work Checklist (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Run automated pre-work check before starting ANY work:**

```bash
./scripts/pre-work-check.sh
```

This script automatically verifies:
1. ✅ **Not on main branch** - Prevents working on main
2. ✅ **Latest main pulled** - Checks for remote updates
3. ✅ **Rule/workflow updates checked** - Checks for real-time rule/workflow updates (real-time collaboration)
4. ✅ **Coordination checked** - Runs `check-agent-coordination.sh`
5. ✅ **Relevant rules discovered** - Suggests applicable cursor rules
6. ✅ **Available tools identified** - Lists automation scripts
7. ✅ **Working directory clean** - Checks for uncommitted changes

**If the script reports errors, fix them before proceeding.**

**Real-Time Collaboration:**
- ✅ **Rules and workflow docs are shared** - Changes propagate immediately via git
- ✅ **Check for updates before work** - `./scripts/check-rule-updates.sh` detects rule/workflow updates
- ✅ **Pull latest main** - Includes rule/workflow updates from other agents
- ✅ **No conflicts** - Rules/workflow docs are read-only during agent work
- ✅ **Improvements benefit all** - Agent improvements to rules/workflow help all agents immediately

**See:** `docs/development/workflow/REAL_TIME_COLLABORATION.md` for complete real-time collaboration model

**Manual steps (if needed):**
1. ✅ **Create isolated worktree** - `./scripts/create-worktree.sh <task-name>` (MANDATORY)
2. ✅ **Work in worktree directory** - `cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>`
3. ✅ **Update coordination doc** - `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`

## File Coordination

**Before modifying files, check coordination:**

**Shared files (require coordination):**
- `app/.../ui/screens/LandingScreen.kt`
- `app/.../ElectricSheepApplication.kt`
- `app/.../data/DataModule.kt`
- `app/build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`

**If modifying shared files:**
1. Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` for conflicts
2. Document your changes in coordination doc
3. **STILL use git worktree** - Isolation is mandatory even for shared files
4. **Exception**: Only if coordination explicitly requires shared workspace (must be documented)
5. Coordinate with other agents if needed

## Workflow Enforcement

**When user asks you to make changes:**

1. **MANDATORY: Run pre-work check first:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-work-check.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify you're not on main
   - Check for remote updates
   - Run coordination checks
   - Discover relevant rules
   - Identify available tools

2. **If on main, STOP and create isolated worktree:**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Use worktree for isolation
   ./scripts/create-worktree.sh <task-name>
   cd ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
   # Now working in isolated directory
   ```

3. **Discover relevant rules:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/discover-rules.sh <task-keyword>
   ```
   Read the suggested rules and reference them explicitly in your implementation.

4. **Before modifying files, check coordination:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-agent-coordination.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Check for shared file conflicts
   - Warn about high-risk files
   - **Verify worktree is being used** (mandatory)

5. **After work, update coordination doc:**
   - Mark work as "In Progress" or "Complete"
   - List files you modified

## Commit Rules

**Before committing:**

1. ✅ **Pre-commit hook runs automatically** - Prevents commits to main
2. ✅ Verify you're on a feature branch (not `main`)
3. ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
4. ✅ Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
5. ✅ Run tests: `./gradlew test` (all tests must pass)

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
[optional: AI-generated code indicator]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**AI Code Provenance (Optional but Recommended):**
- If code was AI-generated: Add `[AI]` prefix or note in body
- If code was AI-generated with human edits: Note significant edits
- Example: `feat: [AI] Add user authentication flow` or `feat: Add feature (AI-generated, human-reviewed)`

**Research shows**: Tracking AI code provenance improves learning and prompt effectiveness

**CRITICAL: Commit Frequently (Safety Net)**
- ✅ **Commit frequently** - Every 15-30 minutes, even if work is incomplete
- ✅ **Use WIP commits** - `git commit -m "WIP: <description>"` for incomplete work
- ✅ **Commit after each logical step** - Don't wait for feature completion
- ✅ **Commit before risky operations** - Before refactoring, large changes, experiments
- ✅ **Local commits only** - No need to push every commit (push when ready for review)

**See:** `.cursor/rules/frequent-commits.mdc` for complete frequent commit guidelines

## Error Prevention

**If you detect these conditions, STOP and fix:**

- ❌ User is on `main` branch → Create isolated worktree immediately
- ❌ Not using worktree → Create worktree before any work (MANDATORY)
- ❌ Branch name doesn't follow convention → Rename branch
- ❌ Modifying shared file without coordination → Check coordination doc first
- ❌ Tests failing → Fix tests before proceeding
- ❌ Uncommitted work on `main` → Move to worktree
- ❌ File system conflicts → Use git worktree for isolation (should already be using it)

## Post-Merge Cleanup (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Run automated cleanup after PR merge:**

```bash
./scripts/post-merge-cleanup.sh <pr-number>
```

This script automatically:
- Checks other active work (worktrees and branches)
- Verifies PR merge status
- Switches to main and pulls latest
- Deletes merged branches
- Removes associated worktrees
- Cleans up temp branches
- Prunes stale worktree references

**Manual cleanup (if automation unavailable):**

### Step 0: Check Other Agents and Worktrees (REQUIRED)

**Before cleaning up, ALWAYS check and report on other active work:**

1. **List all worktrees:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

2. **List all branches (local and remote):**
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

3. **Check for other active work:**
   ```bash
   # List all worktrees with their branches
   git worktree list --porcelain | grep -E "^(worktree|HEAD|branch)" | paste - - -
   
   # List all feature branches
   git branch | grep -E "^  (feature|fix|refactor|docs|test)/"
   
   # List remote branches
   git branch -r | grep -E "(feature|fix|refactor|docs|test)/"
   ```

4. **Report status to user:**
   - List all worktrees and their associated branches
   - List all feature branches (local and remote)
   - Describe the status of each (active, merged, stale)
   - Ask user to verify before deleting anything

**Example output format:**
```
Active Worktrees:
  /path/to/electric-sheep-runtime-visual-evaluation [feature/runtime-visual-evaluation-architecture] - Active work
  /path/to/electric-sheep-other-work [feature/other-task] - Active work

Active Branches:
  feature/runtime-visual-evaluation-architecture - Has unmerged commits
  feature/other-task - Has unmerged commits
  feature/aws-bedrock-security-goals - MERGED (ready to delete)

Please verify these are correct before cleanup proceeds.
```

### Step 1: Switch to Main Branch
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Delete Merged Feature Branch
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/<branch-name>
   # Use -D if branch has unmerged commits (shouldn't happen if PR merged)
   ```

### Step 3: Remove Worktree (if used)
   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../electric-sheep-<task-name>
   # Or if worktree directory was deleted manually:
   git worktree prune
   ```

### Step 4: Delete Duplicate/Old Branches
   ```bash
   # Check for duplicate branches (e.g., -rebased, -old, -backup)
   git branch | grep <branch-name>
   # Delete if duplicate: git branch -D <duplicate-branch>
   ```

### Step 5: Delete Temp/Test Branches
   ```bash
   # Delete branches starting with temp/, tmp/, test-merge, etc.
   git branch | grep -E "^(temp|tmp|test-)" | xargs git branch -D
   ```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents branch clutter
- Avoids confusion about which branch to use
- Keeps repository state clean
- Makes it easier to identify active work

**Best Practice:**
- Always start new work from a fresh `main` branch
- Never continue work on a merged branch
- Create a new feature branch for follow-up work

## Multi-Agent Coordination

**Always:**
- Check `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` before starting
- **Use git worktree for isolation** - MANDATORY for all agents
- Document your work in coordination doc
- Update coordination doc when work status changes
- Coordinate if files overlap with other agents
- **Exception**: Only skip worktree if coordination explicitly requires shared workspace (must be documented)

**Real-Time Collaboration:**
- ✅ **Check for rule/workflow updates** - `./scripts/check-rule-updates.sh` before starting work
- ✅ **Pull latest main** - Includes rule/workflow updates from other agents
- ✅ **Rules/workflow are shared** - Changes propagate immediately via git
- ✅ **Code changes remain isolated** - Use worktrees for all code modifications
- ✅ **No interference** - Rules/workflow updates don't conflict with code work

**See:** 
- `docs/development/workflow/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete multi-agent workflow guidelines
- `docs/development/workflow/REAL_TIME_COLLABORATION.md` - Real-time collaboration model
