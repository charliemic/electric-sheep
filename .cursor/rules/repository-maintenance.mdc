# Repository Maintenance and Cleanup Rules

## CRITICAL: Keep Repository Clean

**Regular maintenance prevents:**
- Branch clutter and confusion
- Working on merged/abandoned branches
- Untracked file accumulation
- Worktree proliferation
- Merge conflicts from stale branches

## Post-Merge Cleanup Checklist

**After every PR merge, complete this checklist:**

### 1. Verify Merge Status
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view <pr-number> --json state,merged

# Verify branch is merged into main
git log main --oneline | grep <commit-hash>
```

### 2. Switch to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Delete Merged Branch
```bash
# Safe delete (only if fully merged)
git branch -d feature/<branch-name>

# Force delete if needed (check first!)
git branch -D feature/<branch-name>
```

### 4. Remove Worktree (if used)
```bash
# If worktree was used for isolation
git worktree remove ../electric-sheep-<task-name>

# Clean up any stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

### 5. Delete Duplicate Branches
```bash
# Check for duplicates (e.g., -rebased, -old, -backup)
git branch | grep <branch-name>

# Delete duplicates
git branch -D feature/<branch-name>-rebased
```

### 6. Delete Temp Branches
```bash
# Find temp branches
git branch | grep -E "^(temp|tmp|test-)"

# Delete them
git branch | grep -E "^(temp|tmp|test-)" | xargs git branch -D
```

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly Cleanup

1. **List all branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. **Check for merged branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch --merged main | grep -v "main"
   ```

3. **Check for stale remote branches:**
   ```bash
   git remote prune origin --dry-run
   ```

4. **List all worktrees:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

5. **Check for untracked files:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
   ```

### Monthly Review

1. **Review unmerged branches:**
   - Check if work is still needed
   - Merge or abandon as appropriate
   - Document decision in `docs/development/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`

2. **Review worktrees:**
   - Verify worktrees are for active work
   - Remove worktrees for completed/abandoned work

3. **Review temp branches:**
   - Delete all temp/test branches
   - Document any that should be kept

## Branch Protection Rules

### Never Do These:
- ❌ Work on a merged branch
- ❌ Keep duplicate branches (-rebased, -old, etc.)
- ❌ Leave temp branches around
- ❌ Keep worktrees for merged work
- ❌ Accumulate untracked files

### Always Do These:
- ✅ Delete merged branches immediately
- ✅ Remove worktrees after merge
- ✅ Start new work from fresh `main`
- ✅ Create new branch for follow-up work
- ✅ Clean up temp branches regularly

## Starting New Work

**Before starting new work:**

1. **Ensure you're on main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Verify clean state:**
   ```bash
   git status  # Should be clean
   ```

3. **Create new feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<new-task>
   ```

4. **Or create worktree for isolation:**
   ```bash
   git worktree add ../electric-sheep-<task-name> -b feature/<task-name>
   ```

## Worktree Management

### When to Use Worktrees
- ✅ Working on shared files (high conflict risk)
- ✅ Multiple agents working simultaneously
- ✅ Need complete file system isolation

### When NOT to Use Worktrees
- ❌ Simple feature work (use branch)
- ❌ Single agent working
- ❌ Low conflict risk

### Worktree Cleanup
- **After merge:** Always remove worktree
- **If abandoned:** Remove worktree and delete branch
- **If continuing:** Keep worktree until merge

## Error Prevention

**If you see these, clean up immediately:**

- Multiple branches with similar names (e.g., `feature/foo`, `feature/foo-rebased`)
- Worktrees pointing to merged branches
- Temp branches older than a few days
- Untracked files accumulating in main repo
- Branches that are merged but still exist locally
